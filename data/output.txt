["Subclass 601\n\nElectronic Travel Authority (Subclass 601)\n\nUp to 3 months at a time\n\nThere is a service charge of AUD20 to use the Australian ETA app. There is no other charge payable for an ETA.\n\nIn most cases you will be notified of the result of your ETA application immediately. Your application may take longer if you do not complete the application process correctly or we require further information. We recommend that you apply well ahead of when you want to travel.\n\nSee all conditions\n\nWith this visa you can\n\nTravel to Australia:\n\nYou can study or train for up to 3 months in total on this visa.

You may be removed or refused entry to Australia.\n\nTo work in Australia, you must hold a visa that permits you to work. See Working in Australia.\n\nHow long you can stay\n\nThis is a temporary visa. It is valid for travel to Australia for either 12 months, or for\xa0the period your passport is valid, whichever is shorter.\n\nThe visa is granted with multiple entry. You can leave and re-enter Australia as many times as you want while it is valid. You can remain in Australia for 3 months after each entry.\n\nIf you stay in Australia for long periods or make frequent visits to Australia, we may ask you about your travel purpose next time you enter Australia. If you are found not to be a genuine visitor, your ETA may be cancelled.\n\nIf you want to stay longer than 3 months at a time, you need to apply for a different visa that suits your circumstances.\n\nThe 12 month visa period starts on the date it is granted unless you hold another substantive visa that is already in effect.\n\nStay longer\n\nYou can't stay in Australia longer by extending this visa. You must apply for another visa.\n\nTo find out about other visas, explore your visa options.\n\nIf you remain in Australia after your ETA ceases, and do not hold another visa to remain, you will become an unlawful non-citizen and you may be removed from Australia.\n\nIncluding family\n\nYou can't include family members, such as children or your spouse, in your application.

If your current passport expires or you get a new passport:\n\nOther visas\n\nIf you hold a Maritime Crew visa or a Special Purpose visa and you are granted an ETA, you will hold both visas concurrently. When you arrive in Australia,\xa0you will enter on both visas. You can stay in Australia for the longer of the 2 visa periods.\n\nIf the longer period exceeds 3 months the ETA will cease, but you can remain for the duration of the other visa's stay period.\n\nIf you hold any other substantive visa and an ETA when you arrive in Australia, you will enter Australia on your other substantive visa, not your ETA. Your ETA will come into effect when the other visa ceases.\n\nHowever, the 3-month ETA stay period still begins when you enter Australia.\n\nCheck your other substantive visa is valid for more than 3 months if you want to stay in Australia longer than the 3-month ETA stay period.\n\nYou must hold a valid passport from one of these countries to be eligible for an ETA. You cannot apply for an ETA with a non-citizen passport, certificate of identity or other travel document, such as a Titre de Voyage.\n\nIf you hold more than one passport, you must declare this in your ETA application and provide details of your other passports.\n\nIf you hold an ETA eligible passport, but you are also an Australian citizen, you cannot\xa0apply for an ETA.
